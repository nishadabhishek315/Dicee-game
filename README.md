# Dicee
This is a dicee project. I made a dice which uses the HTML, CSS and Javascript. This project was build to enhance the knowledge of DOM manipulation.
To run the project locally--

1. Clone the project to your local environment.

2. Copy the address of index.html file location to your browser

3. It will work perfectly fine.
